      <h2>How to get started</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with
        <a href="index.html">bouldering is surprisingly simple.</a> All you need
        are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even
        rent the equipment for your first sessions.
        <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong>
      </p>
